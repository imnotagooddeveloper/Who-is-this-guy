<h2>For Companies / Professional Overview</h2>

<p><em>(If you're a recruiter, employer, or someone looking at my projects professionally, this section is for you!)</em></p>

<h2>Me</h2>

<p>I'm a high school student with a passion for programming, cybersecurity, and reverse engineering. I enjoy breaking things down (and making them not work again even with ctrl+z) to understand how they work and creating my own projects along the way. My goal is to learn everything and push the boundaries of what I can do.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Languages:</strong> C (native), Python, Java</li>
    <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Reverse engineering, malware analysis, OSINT, game modifications</li>
    <li><strong>Currently Learning:</strong> Pointers, system security, and advanced networking</li>
    <li><strong>Unethical?</strong> Little bit unethical and black hat things</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Journey</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Early Beginnings For ME</strong> – Got introduced to computers at 5-6 years old, generating random keys with Cheat Engine and exploring basic game cheats</li>
    <li><strong>Game Hacking Era </strong> – Started scripting in Lua for Roblox, experimenting with in-game exploits and automation.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploring Cybersecurity</strong> – Learned about RCE, OSINT, and vulnerabilities through platforms like 4chan, 2b2t, and various hacking communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Dive into Security</strong> – Entered forums like UnknownCheats, worked with DLL injections, evasion techniques, and explored how antivirus solutions function.</li>
    <li><strong>Malware Development & Networking </strong> – Created backdoors, experimented with payload delivery, and explored hidden file techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Mastering English and Russian </li>
    <li>Advancing my knowledge in low-level programming and cybersecurity</li>
    <li>Expanding my reverse engineering skills for analyzing malwares</li>
    <li>Become best War Thunder Player!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun Fact</h2>

<p>One of the things that keeps me going is War Thunder a game I started playing after a major life event.</p>

<h1>After This is Only For 18- Who Still Learns</h1>

<hr>

<h2>How It All Started – My First Steps into Tech</h2>
<p>I was around <strong>5-6 years old</strong> when my uncle introduced me to <strong>Cheat Engine</strong>. He showed me how to <strong>generate random keys</strong>, and I managed to <strong>play</strong> game (<strong>GTA Vice City</strong>). After that i learned how to <strong>change</strong> things in game.</p>

<p>Then, I got into <strong>mobile game modifications</strong>. I used apps like <strong>Lucky Patcher</strong> and <strong>Game Guardian</strong> to explore how games store data and handle purchases. Even though I didn’t know what I was doing at first, it helped me understand <strong>how software works behind the scenes</strong>.</p>

<h2>From Games to Code – Learning to Program</h2>
<p>Around <strong>2018-2019</strong>, I started playing <strong>Roblox</strong>, and that’s when I discovered <strong>Lua scripting</strong>. With Lua, I could write <strong>small programs</strong> (scripts) that could:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Automate simple tasks in games</li>
    <li>Change how characters moved or behaved</li>
    <li>Create tools for others to use</li>
</ul>

<p>This was my first <strong>real programming experience</strong>—writing code that actually did something!</p>

<p>If you want to start coding, <strong>Lua is a great beginner-friendly language</strong>. It teaches you <strong>variables, loops, and logic</strong> without being too complicated.</p>

<h2>The Internet & Cybersecurity – How Things Work Online</h2>
<p>At some point, I stumbled upon <strong>4chan</strong> and <strong>2b2t (the oldest anarchy Minecraft server)</strong>. This was a huge turning point for me.</p>

<p>I learned about:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How websites and servers work</strong></li>
    <li><strong>What RCE (Remote Code Execution) is</strong> – This is when a program or website lets someone run code they shouldn’t be able to.</li>
    <li><strong>OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)</strong> – Finding public information online, like tracking usernames across platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p>I started asking:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How does the internet really work?</li>
    <li>Why do some programs have <strong>security flaws</strong>?</li>
    <li>How can people <strong>track someone online</strong> using small details?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested in this, look into <strong>how websites are built, how IP addresses work, and how data moves across the internet</strong>.</p>

<h2>Learning More About Programming & Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>When the <strong>pandemic hit</strong>, I had more time to learn. That’s when I joined <strong>UnknownCheats</strong>, a forum where people talk about <strong>game security, programming, and reverse engineering</strong>.</p>

<p>From there, I learned:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What DLL injections are</strong> – This means adding new code to a running program.</li>
    <li><strong>How to write external programs</strong> that interact with games.</li>
    <li><strong>How screen-sharing detection works</strong> – I wanted to understand how companies monitor cheating in games.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to get started with <strong>reverse engineering</strong>, you should first learn <strong>basic C or Python programming</strong>. These languages help you understand how software is built, so you can break it down later.</p>

<h2Understanding Software & Security – How Programs Protect Themselves</h2>
<p>As I got deeper into programming, I started learning about <strong>how security software works</strong> and how programs try to protect themselves.</p>

<p>I explored:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How file extensions work</strong> – Some programs only allow certain file types, but you can sometimes rename files to trick them.</li>
    <li><strong>How antivirus software detects threats</strong> – AV programs look for <strong>patterns in files</strong> to catch bad programs.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was <strong>fascinating</strong> because it showed me how companies <strong>build defenses</strong> against security risks. If you want to learn more, try:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Making a simple antivirus scanner (You can find it on my profile!!!)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Exploring how file formats work (like .exe, .dll, and .zip)</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Understanding Networking – How the Internet Connects Everything</h2>
<p>As I kept learning, I got interested in <strong>networking</strong>—how computers talk to each other over the internet.</p>

<p>Some things I explored:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How routers work</strong> – These are like traffic controllers for your internet.</li>
    <li><strong>How to speed up your internet</strong> – Sometimes, changing router settings can make a difference.</li>
    <li><strong>How wireless networks function</strong> – Most devices connect over WiFi, but not all of them are secure.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to learn about networking, start with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>How IP addresses work</strong></li>
    <li><strong>What DNS is (how websites turn names into numbers)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>How to set up your own local server</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Life, War Thunder, more War Thunder, Sushi Thoughts & The Future</h2>
<p>At one point, I went through a tough breakup with someone I had been with for <strong>5-6 years</strong>. It was hard, yes it was reason of sushi (not the food but the rope one) but I found things that kept me going. Like: <strong>War Thunder, Bad Apple</strong> and <strong>My Cat</strong></p>

<p>If i was did the "sushi" you wouldnt read this. Yes i agree life is like a sabot shell sometimes. It rlly hits hard but if you prepare yourself a bit (angle yourself for tank commanders) you wont even feel it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Where I Am Now & What’s Next</h2>
<p>Right now, I’m focused on:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Learning English & Russian</strong> to connect with more people in tech</li>
    <li><strong>Getting better at low-level programming</strong> (C and system security)</li>
    <li><strong>Building new projects & exploring cybersecurity</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Your mom will always tell you <strong>dont try! dont learn! stay in safe!</strong>. No, if you want make something you need go to frontlines.</p>

<h2>Want to talk?</h2>
<p>You can contact me about anything you want(ETHICAL). Just sayin for comparison. When i waas 14-15 my friends was like "Lets go and kiss girls!! uu yee! yes my dad rich now i'll eat all money!!. While they kissing, spending money or jerking off i did make my cheats and raped them in games. with backdoors i was able to user their computer but they wasnt know it. I was in their wifi but they didnt heard anything from me. Do not care about "gays" like this in life. oh sorry typo.</strong></p>
