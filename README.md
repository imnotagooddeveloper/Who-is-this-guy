<h2>üè¢ For Companies / Professional Overview</h2>

<p><em>(If you're a recruiter, employer, or someone looking at my projects professionally, this section is for you!)</em></p>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm a high school student with a strong passion for programming, cybersecurity, and reverse engineering. I enjoy breaking things down (and making them not work again) to understand how they work and creating my own projects along the way. My goal is to learn everything and push the boundaries of what I can do.</p>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Languages:</strong> C (native), Python, Java</li>
    <li><strong>Experience:</strong> Reverse engineering, malware analysis, OSINT, game modifications</li>
    <li><strong>Currently Learning:</strong> Pointers, system security, and advanced networking</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Journey</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Early Beginnings üéÆ</strong> ‚Äì Got introduced to computers at 5-6 years old, generating random keys with Cheat Engine and exploring game modifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Hacking Era </strong> ‚Äì Started scripting in Lua for Roblox, experimenting with in-game exploits and automation.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploring Cybersecurity</strong> ‚Äì Learned about RCE, OSINT, and vulnerabilities through platforms like 4chan, 2b2t, and various hacking communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Dive into Security</strong> ‚Äì Entered forums like UnknownCheats, worked with DLL injections, evasion techniques, and explored how antivirus solutions function.</li>
    <li><strong>Malware Development & Networking </strong> ‚Äì Created backdoors, experimented with payload delivery, and explored hidden file techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Goals</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Mastering English and Russian üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è</li>
    <li>Advancing my knowledge in low-level programming and cybersecurity</li>
    <li>Expanding my reverse engineering skills</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun Fact</h2>

<p>One of the things that keeps me going is War Thunder‚Äîa game I started playing after a major life event.</p>
